![Paul Treve's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=trevennue)


Yes, I'm a computer engineer, a tech enthusiast and a general lover of math, science and technology. I'm a happy person by nature. I find most things facinating and I, most certainly, do not believe that anything is too difficult to do.
- 👀 It's a great feeling when I'm able to understand the 'why' behind things. I love to learn and acquire new skills in any field I find interesting. I’m interested in knowing how and, most importantly, why things happen. And yes, I love to code! 
- 🌱 I’m currently an undergraduate student reading BSc. Computer Engineering. Python! Machine learning is a field I'm starting to explore.
